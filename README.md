This project is a sample WPF application to shows how to disable Charmbar on a full screen application.

If you already used the new Windows 8/8.1, you probably have  noticed the charmbar which allow you to navigate through multiple application, closed a RT Application, or navigate between multiple settings.

You can make the charmbar visible by moving your mouse to the edge of your screen or simply swipe your finger from the outside of the screen to the inside.

If you are developping a professional application this charmbar can be sometimes difficult to deal with and better to disable as it can interfere with your own gesture. This is especially true if you are building a full screen application.
